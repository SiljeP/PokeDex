# PokeDex
*PokeDex assignment in Dynamic Web, using API for the first time. Due Friday, 15/9 at 15:00.*


### New things I learned during this assignement:
- How to use fetch and .then()
- Using a guard-clause (throw and catch)
- A bit about status codes (like "200" is succes)
- Promises
- That JSON is standard to transfer data from server to server
- Pagination
- Lazy-loading
